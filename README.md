# TheGame
Turn-based Java game for desktops

--------------

The Game is a great strategic game that is very "simple" to pick up. A wide range of well-balanced monsters makes each and every one of the games unique and engaging.

There are only two persons in the world who play this game so writing down rules is pointless.

I'm completely rewriting the structure of the game in order to provide online matches.
