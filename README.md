# TheGame
Turn-based Java game for desktops

--------------

The Game is a great strategic game that is very "simple" to pick up. A wide range of well-balanced monsters makes each and every one of the games unique and engaging.

There are only two persons in the world who play this game so writing down rules is pointless.

----------

Features: PvP on one computer or via LAN.

Plans: implement AI, playing using central server in some cloud environment.

I think I'll stop with this project for a moment as I'm simply not having fun. It's high time to try something new I guess.
